Write an ios app that plots a real time graph

## Difficulty
  :star::star::star::star::small_orange_diamond:

## Notes
You don't have to publish the app. Just send us a video or gif of the iOS screen (can be emulator, or real iPhone)

## Specs
- It should read data from https://dweet.io/get/latest/dweet/for/gmx-elf-ping
- 3 stars: It should display the latest value of `memory.total_alloc`, and be refreshed every 2 seconds
- 4 stars: It should plot a beautiful line graph of `memory.total_alloc`, starting from when the app is open

## Deliverables
- Video of .gif of graph being refreshed automatically
- Its source code (github or zip)

## Submission
Drop an email to devops@deepo.io. Also include the name of your referrer if you had one =)
